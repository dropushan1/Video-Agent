You are an intelligent data analyst. Your task is to analyze the 'Raw Text' from video transcripts or image extractions and generate structured metadata for each item.

Here is the list of items to process:
{items_json}

For EACH item, you must output a JSON object with the following fields:
- id: The unique ID provided in the input.
- Title: A suitable title based on the content (TikTok/Twitter style).
- Summary: Short summary of the transcript.
- Category: Choose ONE from the provided list.
- Tags: Choose appropriate tags from the provided list (comma separated).
- Types: Choose ONE from the provided list.
- Refined Text: A refined version of the Raw Text (remove fillers, keep info, strictly based on key info).
- Niche: Identify the niche (e.g. self-improvement, business, etc).

OPTIONS:
Categories: {categories}
Tags: {tags}
Types: {types}

RULES:
1. Prefer using the provided Categories, Tags, and Types.
2. If NONE of the options fit perfectly, you MAY create a new Category, Tag, or Type but only if there isnt any close match.
3. If you create a NEW Category, Tag, or Type, you MUST append a " (NEW)" suffix to it in the JSON output so we can detect it.
4. Return the result as a raw JSON list of objects. Do not wrap in markdown code blocks if possible, or just standard JSON.
